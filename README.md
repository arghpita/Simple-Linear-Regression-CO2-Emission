# Simple-Linear-Regression-CO2-Emission
Using the scikit-learn library to implement Simple linear regression on a dataset that is related to fuel consumption and Carbon dioxide emission of cars. 
We split our data into training and test sets, create a model using a training set, evaluate our model using test set, and finally use model to predict unknown values.
